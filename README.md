# Ping Pong Game

This repository contains the scripts for a simple Ping Pong game developed in Python. The game is designed to run in a graphical window where players can control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.py`: The main script to run the Ping Pong game.
- `ball.py`: Script to manage the ball's behavior and movement.
- `paddle.py`: Script to manage the paddles' behavior and movement.
- `scoreboard.py`: Script to manage the game's scoring system.
- `env/`: Directory containing the virtual environment for the project.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

## Installation
After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Game
To start the game, run the main.py script:
python main.py

## File Descriptions
main.py: This is the main entry point of the game. It initializes the game window, sets up the game loop, and handles the game events.
ball.py: Contains the Ball class that manages the ball's position, movement, and collision detection with the paddles and window borders.
paddle.py: Contains the Paddle class that manages the paddles' position and movement. The paddles can be controlled by the player to hit the ball.
scoreboard.py: Contains the Scoreboard class that keeps track of and displays the score for each player.
